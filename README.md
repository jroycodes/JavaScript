**JavaScript** is a high level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. In other word it transforms a web page from a static display of information to an interactive more responsive web page. It works hand in hand with HTM - Hyper Text Markup Language and CSS to bring to life a web page.

JavaScript frameworks and libraries include: React, Angular and View. 

Therefore,

**HTML** - responsible for the content of the page (text, images and buttons on the web site.)

**CSS** - responsible for styling of the content on the web page.

**JavaScript** - adds responsiveness and dynamics to the web page.
